# Connection to API backend

We will get data from our API which functions as our backend.
The API is another project of mine, that provides this project with a list of ingredients.

We can then call an endpoint on the API with the ingredients we've selected, and get a result that tells us what recipies we can follow.

## How are we calling the API?

- We are using the libary Axios
  -npm install axios
